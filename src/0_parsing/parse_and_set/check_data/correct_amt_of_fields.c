/*
Checks if the type id (ambience, light, etc) has the correct amount of fields,
also taking a potential newline into account, e.g.:
A 0.0,1.0,42.0 0.9     
(This example would end with a newline since there are spaces after last field,
this function also takes care of this.)
@param len The length of the array (how many fields). When it is used with
-1, it's to adjust it to index instead of length.
@param expected_len How many fields is the element supposed to have.*/
