/**
Function to find the intersection of a ray with a plane.
 @param ray_ori 	The origin of the ray.
 @param ray_dir		The normalized direction vector of the ray.
 @param obj			Pointer to the object data.
 @param t 			A pointer to store the distance to the intersection point.

 @return 			`1` if the ray intersects the plane within the FOV
					(`t` is set to the intersection distance);
					`0` if there is no intersection within the FOV (ray is
					parallel to the plane or intersection behind the camera).

 @note
Due to floating-point precision limitations, directly comparing a dot product
to zero can be unreliable. A small threshold (EPSILON -> 1e-6) is used to
determine if the ray is parallel to the plane. Values below this threshold are
considered too close to zero, indicating parallelism or preventing division by
very small numbers, which could lead to inaccuracies.
