/**
Calculates the discriminant of a quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, which
solves into `x = (-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a`.

The discriminant `D = b^2 - 4ac` tells us:
- if `D > 0`, there are two real roots (the ray intersects the object at two
  points).
- if `D = 0`, there is one real root (the ray is tangent to the object, touching
  it at one point).
- if `D < 0`, there are no real roots (the ray does not intersect the object).

 @param a 	The coefficient of the quadratic term in quadratic equation.
 @param b 	The coefficient of the linear term in quadratic equation.
 @param c 	The constant term in quadratic equation.

 @return 	The discriminant of the quadratic equation.
